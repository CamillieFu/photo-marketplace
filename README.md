# Photo marketplace

This project was created as a mock photo marketplace webpage.
The site hosts photos which can be favorited, added to a cart and "purchased"
(There is no attached database so of course, users cannot sign in or save their preferences if the page is reloaded)

Design is minimal, black and white and focus on the product (images)
